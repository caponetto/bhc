# Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering in python
This is a python implementation of the Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering algorithm proposed by Heller & Ghahramani (2005).
> HELLER, Katherine A.; GHAHRAMANI, Zoubin. Bayesian hierarchical clustering. In: **Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on Machine learning**. 2005. p. 297-304.

## How to run the code
1. Create an anaconda environment using the file [environment.yml](environment.yml).

`$ conda env create -f environment.yml`

2. Activate the environment after the installation is completed.

`$ conda activate bayesian-hierarchical-clustering`

3. Run the file [example.py](example.py).

`$ python example.py`

4. Check out the output images in the [results](results/) folder. 

**Note**: You can optionally add your own data in the file [data.csv](data/data.csv) but the hyperparameters must be optimized.
